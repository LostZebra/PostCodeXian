# PostCodeXian

Provide users living in Xi'an with a convenient way to search for postcodes of specific positions, which could be a 
general one such as a administrative district, a street or a more accurate one such as a store, a restaurant, etc.

There are three ways searching for postcodes: 1) Local data set which is grabbed from a public website; 2) Geolocat-
ion based module which pinpoint your current location; 3) Search online.

This project is developed based on Windows Phone 8.1 SDK.

User interface files and their ViewModels are listed under root directory, /Assets contains all icons and pics, /Da-
taModel contains all Models, /Common contains individual modules.
